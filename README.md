# Python Logic & Edge Case Evaluation Suite
**Focus:** AI Model Benchmarking & RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)

## Project Overview
This repository serves as a technical demonstration of my ability to evaluate, debug, and optimize Python code. In the context of AI training, I focus on identifying logical fallacies, handling edge cases, and ensuring "Gold Standard" accuracy for Large Language Model (LLM) outputs.

## Skills Demonstrated
* **Edge Case Identification:** Handling empty inputs, negative integers, and type mismatches.
* **Logic Critique:** Identifying "hallucinations" where code runs but produces incorrect results.
* **Technical Writing:** Providing clear, concise explanations of why specific code fails or succeeds.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `python main.py` to see the comparison between flawed logic and optimized logic.
3. Review the docstrings in `main.py` for detailed reasoning on the optimizations made.

**Technical Setup:** Developed on a 16GB RAM environment using VS Code.
